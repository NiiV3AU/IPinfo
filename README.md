# IPinfo
## Small Description
Small Python GUI build with Customtkinter, that reveals your current IPv4 Adresse, Geolocation (Country Code) and Country Flag.

# Use Cases
Very limited, gets the info as fast as simply visiting [BrowserLeaks](https://browserleaks.com) by itself.
> *'psst* ~ it looks cooler :)

# Why then, you ask?
The Project teached me new things as using threading for a more responsive gui, scraping the web with bs4 (BeautifulSoup) and improved my overall python skills. I also uploaded the project on GitHub to get some feedback on my code, so I would appreciate it if you would take your time reviewing my code on flaws etc.

# How it looks

### What you can't see here are the nice animations of the button and the credits.
> Also fyi if youre wondering why IPinfo shows N/A aka Not Available rather then the actual data, its because you need to click the refresh buttom at the bottom to start the data collection. If the GUI started with the data already scraped, then the GUI would not feel as responsive as it currently is.

# Requirements to run IPinfo
